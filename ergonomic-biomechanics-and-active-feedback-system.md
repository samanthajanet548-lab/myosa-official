# MYOSA EBAFS

The **MYOSA Ergonomic Biomechanics and Active Feedback System (EBAFS)** integrates three modules — active posture compliance, gamified exercise, and environmental monitoring — into a unified platform.

## Overview

* **Posture Module:** Enforces active compliance by blacking out the laptop screen and sounding a buzzer when slouching is detected. User needs to sit back straight to be able to resume work.
* **Fitness Module:** Gamifies exercise through a custom developed game where the NemoBird character jumps to avoid tree obstacles when a bicep curl is performed.
* **Environment Module:** Monitors ambient light, pressure, and temperature, issuing warnings via buzzer and OLED display in low-light conditions.
